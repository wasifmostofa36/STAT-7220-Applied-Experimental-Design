        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "- In the last section, we learned some of the basics of experimental design.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In this section, we will begin to learn about specific *designs* we can employ to analyze our data and answer our research questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Let's begin by discussing an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Research Scenario\n",
        "\n",
        "- Suppose we work for a company that manufactures high-end canned beverage coolers (like [these](https://www.yeti.com/drinkware/can-insulators/colster-12oz.html)). We are considering launching a new cooler and have two designs in mind. One design uses hard plastic and the other uses stainless steel. Since our goal is to maximize the amount of time the beverage stays cold, we want to know which design is better at keeping the beverage cold.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Planning the Experiment\n",
        "\n",
        "- Now that we have a general sense of what our goal is with the experiment, we need to plan the experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Recall from the last section that the steps in planning a successful experiment are:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Define the objective\n",
        "    2. Decide what the outcome is (and how it will be measured)\n",
        "    3. Determine the independent variables and possible lurking variables\n",
        "    4. Choose the design\n",
        "    5. Be clear on data collection processes/procedures\n",
        "    6. Be clear on which analyses will be performed\n",
        "    7. Draw conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Define the Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "- First, we must define the objective.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Here, our objective is to determine which of the two cooler materials is better at keeping canned beverages cold.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Specify the Outcome\n",
        "\n",
        "- Next, we must decide what our outcome variable is and how we will measure it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- You can probably think of several ways to do this, but for the sake of this example, let's define the outcome as the temperature of the beverage (in degrees Fahrenheit) after it has been in the cooler for two hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Determine the Independent Variable & Possible Lurking Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "- Now, we need to decide what our independent variable will be an what potential lurking variables may exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Our IV will be the material type.\n",
        "\n",
        "- While we may have some lurking variables depending on the way we conduct the experiment, we can eliminate many if not all of them by having careful control over:\n",
        "    - Starting temperature of the canned beverages\n",
        "    - Consistency of room temperature in room where the cans will be set out for two hours\n",
        "\n",
        "- To control the starting temperature of the canned beverages, we can keep the cans in the same refrigerator for 24 hours prior to the experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "- To control the consistency of the room temperature, we will place the cans on a table in a room kept at a consistent temperature and with the window shades closed.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Choose the Design\n",
        "\n",
        "- In our syllabus, you can see that we have lots of different designs to choose from (e.g., completely randomized design, split-plot, $2^k$, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "- The choice of design is largely a function of our independent variable(s) and how we are conducting the experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Perhaps the most important element of any experimental design are the concepts of *replication* and *randomization*.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Randomization** means that our experimental units are randomly partitioned into treatment groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Recall from the email marketing example in the last section, our customer base was randomly assigned to be in either the generic email group or the personalized email group. This is an example of randomization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Randomization is an important way to eliminate potential sources of variability to ensure that the conclusions we draw are accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In the email example, imagine we didn't do randomization and we accidentally assigned all female customers to the generic group and all male customers to the personalized group.\n",
        "    - Whatever differences we observe between the email groups will be *confounded* with customer sex.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Replication** refers to having more than one experimental unit in a specific treatment group.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In our cooler example, we would not perform the temperature test by using only one can in the hard plastic cooler and one in the stainless steel cooler. We would want more *replicates* (typically denoted by $r$).\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Why? Two reasons!\n",
        "\n",
        "- First, without replication, we wouldn't be able to tell if treatment differences are real or just a random manifestation of the particular experimental units used in the study.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Second and relatedly, when we only have one replicate, we don't have variance (the variance of a constant is 0, as you will learn in mathematical statistics).\n",
        "\n",
        "- And if we don't have variance, none of our hypothesis tests will work!\n",
        "\n",
        "- Deciding on the value of $r$ can be a statistical conversation (i.e., power analysis) but often it's a practical one (how much time or money will it cost me to produce a certain number of replicates?).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Now, circling back to choosing a specific design, in our case, our experimental units (the canned beverages) are essentially the same. Through our procedure of performing the experiment, we've eliminated any other major lurking variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Thus, the best design for comparing the effects of our two treatment groups would be a **completely randomized design**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In a **CRD**, all experimental units are randomly assigned to a treatment and each unit has an equal chance of being in one of the treatment groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - For us, we could number each can and use the Python function `sample` which is part of the `random` package in order to determine which can goes into which cooler.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Suppose we decide to have $r=30$ replicates for each of our $t=2$ treatment groups to make for a total sample size of $n = r\\times t = 30 \\times 2 = 60$.\n",
        "\n",
        "- We would number our cans 1 - 60. Then using `random.sample`:"
